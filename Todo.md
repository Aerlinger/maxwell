## TODOs and stuff:

Overall the engine is pretty stable. Thus, the current focus is on improving test coverage so that we can safely refactor.

1. Test two-way serialization/deserialization of CircuitComponent, Circuit, CircuitParams
2. Test updating the parameters of a CircuitComponent while it is running
3. Oscilloscope rendering
4. Cleaner rendering through D3?
