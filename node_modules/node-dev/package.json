  "readme": "About\n=====\n\nNode-dev is a development tool for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that automatically restarts the node process when a script is modified.\n\nWith node-dev you don't have to manually specify which files should be watched nor do you have to deal with ignore lists for files that should be excluded. This is done using a thin wrapper script that hooks into the `require()` function as well as into several methods of the [VM](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/vm.html) module to determine which files need to be monitored.\n\nThis does not only work for _.js_ files, but also for _.json_ or _.node_ or  _.coffee_ files or any other custom extension that has been added to `require.extensions`.\n\nAnother great benefit of this zero-config approach is that it doesn't cause __any unnecessary restarts__ when for example client-side only scripts are modified.\n\nDesktop Notifications\n=====================\n\nStatus and error messages are displayed as desktop notification using either [Growl](http://growl.info/about.php) or [libnotify](http://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/).\n\n![Screenshot](http://fgnass.github.com/images/node-dev.png)\n\n![Screenshot](http://fgnass.github.com/images/node-dev-linux.png)\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSimply use the `node-dev` binary as you would normally use `node`.\n\n__Note:__ All arguments are passed on to the child-process. `node-dev --debug app.js` will debug your application, not the supervisor itself.\n\nYou may also use node-dev with [CoffeeScript](http://http://coffeescript.org/) apps. Just run `node-dev app.coffee` -- that's all.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nNode-dev can be installed via [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):\n\n    npm install -g node-dev\n\nThis will install `node-dev` and make it globally available (note the `-g` option).\n\nIn order to use Growl notifications [growlnotify](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify) must be installed on your system.\n\nSettings\n========\n\nYou can set the `NODE_DEV_CLEARSCREEN` environment variable to `true` if in order to automatically clear the terminal screen upon restarts.\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n* [Ricardo Tomasi](https://github.com/ricardobeat) (CoffeeScript support)\n* [Sergey Ovechkin](https://github.com/pomeo) (libnotify support)\n",
