---------------------

Thanks to @Wisdom, @nilbus, @joelvh, @gabipurcaru, @michaelficarra, @tricknotes,

### Changed:
  * Compile `!!` into `!!` instead of `not not`. (#30)
  * Implement CRLF support. Closes (#81, #88)

  * Fix the problem where passing an anonymous function as a parameter can
    sometimes lead to syntax errors. (#55)

v0.1.0 - Jun 13, 2011
---------------------

Lots of refactoring and new improvements.

### Added:
  * Single line ifs. `if (x) continue;` will now compile to `continue if x`.

### Refactoring:
  * Lots and lots of refactoring.
  * `Builder` is now a class (to support warnings in the future, and more).
  * Implement a new `Transformer` class to do AST transformations before building the compiled source.
  * Recursive functions now use `Node::walk()`.
  * Move stuff into `js2coffee/helpers.coffee` and `js2coffee/node_ext.coffee`.

v0.0.5 - Jun 10, 2011
---------------------

Special thanks to [Michael Ficarra](http://github.com/michaelficarra) for agressively
reporting issues and suggesting numerous improvements.

### Added:
  * Account for negative existence checks (`if !x?`). (#19)
    * Compile `if (x != null)` to `unless x?`
    * Compile `if (x === null)` to `if x?`
  * Ensure object literals with more than one property get surrounded by `({ .. })`. (#8)
  * Support `debugger`. (#27)
  * Support destructuring in functions. (#17)
  * Use `loop` instead of `while true` in while and for loops. (#35)
  * Use the `::` prototype operator. (#24)
  * Use `unless` and `until` as the inverse of `if` and `while` respectively. (#35)

### Fixed:
  * Keys in object literals now get quoted if needed. This fixes the erroneous
    compilation of objects such as `{ 'click #button': function() { ... } }`.

v0.0.4 - Jun 09, 2011
---------------------

### Changed:
  * Allow single-line JS comments without a newline in the end.
  * Enquote identifiers in object literals as needed. (#16)
  * Ensure that percent interpolation (%i) don't get messed up in the Node version. (#13)
  * Ensure that when anonymous functions are called, they are parenthesized. (#14)

### Added:
  * more tests.

### Fixed:
  * `++b` is now no longer erroneously translated to `b++`.
  * Fixed an issue where `{ off: 2 }` erroneously becomes `{ off_: 2 }`.
  * Returning object literals should now not create invalid CoffeeScript. (#15)

### Misc:
  * Annotate the source code.
  * Make a simpler (but less stringent) JS packing routine for `js2coffee.min.js`.

v0.0.3 - Jun 05, 2011
---------------------

### Fixed:
  * Narcissus to not go into an infinite loop in the browser.
  * Use `this` instead of `@` for better readability. (#10)

  * Implement += and friends. (#9)
  * Use 'cake' instead of 'make'.

v0.0.2 - June 4, 2011
---------------------

### Changed:
  * Better string escaping
  * Better handling of empty blocks
  * Support for commas (eg: `a = 2, b = 3`)

  * Switch/case now uses `switch` instead of `if`
  * Some other improvements
